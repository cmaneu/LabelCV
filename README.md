# LabelCV
LabelCV is a service used to build a labeled image dataset via crowdsourcing. Researchers, companies and 
datascientists can use LabelCV to spinup a website where people can tag an existing image dataset or 
contribute to this dataset by uploading images.

## This project is under **heavy** development

What you'll find in this project is very early stage. I've decided to opensource it from the begining so people can follow it as 
it's built. Do not use it for any other usage than learning.

## The story behind LabelCV

LabelCV was created as a sample for [Caf√© Dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSFIjQQBpP6_dNJGwJM5sDQ) YouTube channel to demonstrate how to build Cloud Native apps. It will be used for different Non-Profit organisation projects soon.
